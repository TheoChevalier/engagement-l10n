Dear [firstname],


;At this time of year, I like to stop and reflect. To remind myself where we are, how we got here, and to look forward at the upcoming year.

;In the last few years, we’ve grown Mozilla so that it isn’t just the maker of an ethical, privacy-friendly browser – it’s also focused on fueling the movement for internet health. With your support, we’re becoming more and more like a Greenpeace for the internet.
In the last few years, we’ve grown Mozilla so that it isn’t just the maker of an ethical, privacy-friendly browser – it’s also focused on fueling the movement for internet health. With your support, we’re becoming more and more like a Greenpeace for the internet.


;The urgent need to grow the energy and momentum behind this movement became incredibly clear this year: events like the <a>Cambridge Analytica/Facebook</a> scandal catapulted internet health issues into the mainstream. It happened much quicker than we anticipated. But the work that you have helped us to do means that we were, and continue to be, poised to quickly highlight the bigger issues at play and push Facebook to make real changes to its products.

;The need to stand up on issues of internet health is clearer than ever, and — thanks to your support — we are in the right place at the right time. From Cambridge Analytica to outrage over the impact of fake news, these issues are human issues that connect back to you and me — average people using the internet everyday, all the time. It’s time to really focus on the question: how do we make the internet more human, and humane?

;In action, that means taking the issues that you and I already care about, and then connecting them to what our friends and relatives are thinking about in their everyday interactions with technology. The <a>Holiday Buyer’s Guide</a> that we put out this year is an example of how we can do this. I’m hoping that the guide was useful to you, personally – but I hope even more that you shared it with those around you who are not yet asking ‘is this connected teddy bear safe?’ Together, we need to do more of this kind of thing.

;And as I look ahead to 2019, it feels like the time to put our foot on the gas pedal. People are paying attention to once-arcane issues like privacy and the power of platform – issues you and I care about. It’s time to seize this opportunity and do some bold things together.

;In closing, I want to reiterate: the world needs a Greenpeace for the internet right now. A voice for an internet that is human and humane. Together, you, I and millions of Mozilla supporters around the world can be this voice. Thank you — for your activism, for your participation on these issues, and for your financial support of Mozilla. We can’t do this without you.
