Congratulations! Thank you so much – because you acted, we’re starting to see real change.

;If people want ads that are targeted to them, they should be able to turn these features on. Having cross-site tracking on by default isn’t okay, since many users may not have understood this kind of data collection was happening in the first place.

;One thing that is clear from this week is that people want to know what type of data companies collect about them. Cross-site tracking often results in collection of people’s data without a lot of transparency.

;As Congress gears up for its upcoming hearings about Facebook, we have a great opportunity to highlight this issue and build on our winning momentum to get Facebook - and other online companies - to create this change and hopefully set off a wider industry discussion about transparency and user choice.
