Dear Mozilla Supporter,


;It’s a complicated world out there.
It’s a complicated world out there.


;You have a browser — sometimes two or three, you have a world of apps, you have connected devices. Each one of them is doing something useful. But many of them are also collecting a sea of data.
You have a browser — sometimes two or three, you have a world of apps, you have connected devices. Each one of them is doing something useful. But many of them are also collecting a sea of data.


;Today, your ability to protect yourself or customize your own experience or have control over what happens to you on the internet is severely limited. You shouldn’t have to carry that burden alone.

;Because who else in the world is going to help you navigate this sea of data? Who else will be a responsible steward of data? Who else can build a responsible ecosystem that acknowledges the value of data and applies it for your benefit but not the benefit of a few shareholders?

;The fact that you are the product. This is unacceptable. We know how to play defense — to block trackers and hide searches. I want us to play offense. I want Mozilla to go out into world and make sure you are not the product and that your data is used in a way that makes sense to you.This won’t happen today or tomorrow. It’s a commitment we’re making for the long haul.

;Content. The web is content. Today it is hard to know what is real and what is lies. Mozilla has the people with the expertise who need to be in this dialogue. We have the people who need to be experimenting on how to fix this.

;The addiction economy. Most of us don’t even realize how much time and money go into making us take actions on the internet that are profitable. Very few of us alone are capable of understanding the power of the complex systems today aimed at pushing and pumping addictive behavior. It will take technologists building and experimenting with different forms of interaction to create new ways of engaging with data and information to tackle this enormous problem.

;People are asking, “The internet is broken, what can I do?” One important part of the answer is, build a relationship with Mozilla.

;Make it as deep as you want. Sign up, ask your friends and family to sign up, <a>donate</a>. You should have a relationship with Mozilla. That’s where you can improve the internet as you improve your own experience on the internet.
