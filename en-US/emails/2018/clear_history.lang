;Facebook just announced a new "clear history" setting that allows users to choose not to have their cross-site data used for targeting — both with ads and social posts. And they're going to allow you to remove the data from your profile.

;Tens of thousands of people in our community called on Facebook to stop cross-site tracking for advertising — using your browsing on other sites. It made such a stink that Mark Zuckerberg was asked several questions specifically about cross-site tracking at the US Congressional hearings last month.

;Don’t get me wrong — the Clear History tool is a step in the right direction, but we must push to ensure Facebook gives users meaningful control over how their data is being collected and used.

;Cross-site tracking often results in collection of people's data without a lot of transparency. This is a problem bigger than just Facebook — but if we can get Facebook to change, we think we can push other large platforms to make this change too.

;We are asking Facebook to turn on Clear History for all users — and stop using cross-site tracking to monetize their users by default.

;P.S. This kind of change is only possible because of people like you. We're working to make these kinds of options — on platforms, browsers, and everywhere on the internet — the norm, instead of the exception. If you'd like to keep the good news keeps coming, <a>could you make a donation today?</a> Anything you can spare makes a huge difference!
