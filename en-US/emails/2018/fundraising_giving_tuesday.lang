;I took a moment to pause and reflect on 2018 today. It’s not been an easy year. But as I started to dwell on the hard parts of the year, I stopped myself. Yes, in a lot of ways 2018 has been a hard year. But for every difficult thing that happened this year I was able to think of a reason to feel hopeful. When I looked back at all those reasons, they had one thing in common.

;You — over 26,000 of you signed on to hold Venmo accountable when one of our Mozilla Fellows accessed every public transaction made on the financial app. Highlighting those startling private details from Venmo’s publicly available data brought about a much  needed conversation around what personal information should be public.

;You — tens of thousands of you stood up in the fight to protect net neutrality. We faced a setback with the vote to effectively end net neutrality in the United States, but we’re not giving up. Just last week <a>we filed arguments</a> in the US courts to keep the fight going. Our efforts to reinstate net neutrality in the United States will continue.

;You — thousands of you made Facebook listen when the awful news broke of how Facebook and Cambridge Analytica had played fast and loose and irresponsible with millions of users’ personal information. And because of you, Facebook is definitely listening.

;You — so many of you all across Europe stood up and fought for better copyright reforms. It has been a long fight, and while it’s not yet over, things aren’t quite where we hoped they’d be. But we fought! We didn’t stand by and watch as the internet was undermined. You stood up for what was right.

;And that’s why I’m going to look back on 2018 and not focus on the hard parts. I’m going to look back on 2018 and focus on you. On all the passion you showed. On all the caring you showed. On all the hope you showed in the constant fight for a better internet, a better world. And make no mistake, those two go hand in hand.
