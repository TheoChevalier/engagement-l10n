Nous avons remis une carte de remerciement géante au Guardian pour avoir lutté contre la désinformation


;Hey [firstname],
Bonjour [firstname],


;Two weeks ago I loaded a giant thank you card onto the tube in central London to deliver a message of thanks to The Guardian newspaper, on behalf of 27,000 of you. The Guardian is preventing misinformation by adding more context to news articles shared on social media, so we decided to say “thank you” in a <a>really big way</a>.

;I promised the team at The Guardian that I’d say “thanks” right back to you: they were so happy that you recognised that they’re taking steps to thwart online misinformation, and working to defend the integrity of journalism in a digital age. But don’t just take my word for it, watch the video of me delivering the (giant!) thank you card to The Guardian’s offices in London, UK:
