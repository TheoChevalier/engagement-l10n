;Privacy and security are all over the news lately. From large-scale data breaches like Equifax, to the more recent news of oodles of Facebook data being shared with Cambridge Analytica, a lot of people have started seriously considering what it all means for our digital lives these days.

;You see, we believe strongly that regular internet users like you should have a lot more control of your own data — what is collected, who collects it, and how it is shared, bought, or sold. We think privacy should always be top of mind, and that companies and organizations should adopt lean data practices instead of vacuuming up every byte of information about you that they possibly can.

;<strong>Policy Matters — a lot.</strong> We’re working on several campaigns around the world — such as in India, where we’re very involved in the debate over data protection and the Aadhaar (India’s national biometric identity database) — arguing for strong privacy and security protections.
